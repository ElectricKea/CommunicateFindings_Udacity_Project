      "['.. I\\'m gonna follow my heart.\\\\\\\\ <BR>My favorite line on this album off of the highest point on this album, \\\\\\\\\"Get Em High,\\\\\\\\\" featuring epic rappers Talib Kweli and Common. I loved it because it influences me and inspires me, but after learning that this was the genius that produced five star tracks such as Poppa Was A Playa by Nas and Izzo by Jay-Z, I wanted to pick up this solely for the beats. I wasn\\'t as interested in hearing him as a rapper, because I hadn\\'t even heard Through the Wire or All Falls Down at the time. But, I wasn\\'t disappointed at all, this guy is one of the best \\\\\\\\\"new artist\\\\\\\\\" rappers I\\'ve heard in a long time. This guy knows how to write intellectual flows addressing issues (a la \\\\\\\\\"All Falls Down\\\\\\\\\"), but then writing funny verses that you can find in his very own \\\\\\\\\"Workout Plan.\\\\\\\\\" He also raps really good, and writes really good lyrics for each song. I think it was creative how in \\\\\\\\\"Through The Wire,\\\\\\\\\" he rapped with his teeth wired shut after a fatal car accident. The only low points on this album, in my opinion, are the words of J. Ivy on Never Let Me Down and the 7 (!) skits and interludes, that I find myself skipping constantly. A while ago, I would\\'ve said the narrative on Last Call also, but learning about how The College Dropout came to be over and over again sort of grew on me. Either way, if you want to hear a fresh new voice in rap, pick this up now. This can also be a great listen for long-time fans of rap. After a few listens, you\\'ll agree with me, we\\'ll probably be hearing more from the self proclaimed \\\\\\\\\"first n***a with a Benz and a backpack!\\\\\\\\\" Did I say he was original, too? ;)']\n",
      "[\"I'll probably be among the few to say &#34;the emperor has no clothes&#34; about the raves surrounding this film, but I will anyway since it's only my opinion to take or leave.<br /><br />OK, so not a lot of time to develop characters within a 2-hr movie, but I thought this aspect of &#34;Behind the Candelabra&#34; movie was way too light, and the lack of motives exploration and emotional depth made the movie flat and lackluster for me.  I also thought Matt Damon was a lot more believable as a boy-toy than Michael Douglas was as a queeny older star, but again,  I'm likely in the minority here.<br /><br />For me ,above all, the highlights of this movie were: a glimpse at the kitschy interior of Liberace's house, and the thought that 2 straight hunks like Damon and Douglas were cool enough to play gay men.

      "['It seems every time a Navy SEAL opens his mouth or writes a book, he becomes a pariah. One thing I have learned about free speech in this country in the post 9/11 world is that it is definitely conditional. As long as what you say or write passes the political correctness test, you can say what you want. Otherwise, you will be shouted down and silenced if you have the audacity to speak your mind. Do these very brave men cease to have the right to voice an opinion once they put on the uniform and swear to uphold the Constitution that provides that unalienable right? I do not believe they do. I ask of the people who are critical of Mark Owen if they expected to see the literary prose and precise grammar of a university English professor? I got this book with the expectation of reading of this SEAL\\'s background and the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, and it absolutely did not fail on either count. This brave group of SEALS carried out, successfully, the most important military operation since D-Day. The training they go through is the toughest, period, Amen, and if I was in a life or death situation, I would want them running the show. I think pages 292-293 show conclusively why the White House did not want this released before the election. No great mystery why, it is obviously a major embarrassment. If I were in the military, and in particular, the SEALS, I would look at meetings with members of either party as a huge waste of my time, not to mention very degrading. After the bombast and pandering, America\\'s veterans are routinely tossed under the bus. This SEAL, along with his teammates, and the other SEAL teams as well, were ready to give their lives for all of us so we could continue to enjoy all our freedoms. It seems the government is the least appreciative of their efforts, and these guys all seem to know it. This book is anything but a waste of time, and is really a great first person look into a very historical date for America, as well as a turning point in our war on terror. Having reviewed \\\\\\\\SEAL Team Six\\\\\\\\\" by Howard Wasdin, and presently reading \\\\\\\\\"American Sniper\\\\\\\\\" by the late Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, these genuine American heroes have never ceased to amaze me. As I said in the review of \\\\\\\\\"SEAL Team Six\\\\\\\\\", these men embody General Douglas MacArthur\\'s definition of a soldier (see review). I see all of the positive reviews of this book and agree with them. To the negative ones I will leave them with this; \\\\\\\\\"Would all of you have felt a whole lot better if the President and Vice President that were getting embarrassed were Bush and Cheney?\\\\\\\\\", and to the foreign readership of Amazon\\'s reviews I would ask, especially those in countries who fake support for us, only to stab us in the back later; \\\\\\\\\"What exactly would you have had us do after September 11, 2001?\\\\\\\\\"These guys are the best we have, and when Army Rangers and Marines can look up to them, despite inter-service rivalries, that speaks volumes. No waste of time and money for this reviewer. Damned glad I read it!']\n",
