      "[\"With recent outstanding performances in the Aviator, The Departed and in this movie DiCaprio is becoming a powerhouse on the big screen. Here he is fantastic and believable as Danny Archer, a mercenary from Zimbabwe. His true accent and mannerisms suggest he studied well for this part. Even in his use of inconsequential dialog he gets it right- for instance responding 'ya' instead of the more typical 'yeah.'<br /><br />Archer is no saint here. He smuggles diamonds out of war torn Sierra Leone for a living. After getting arrested he runs into Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou)and learns that Vandy has a gigantic diamond hidden away somewhere. Amidst all the violence and turmoil in Sierra Leone they form an uneasy partnership. Vandy wants to get his kidnapped son back and Archer needs to make good to his criminal partners for the diamonds he has lost. Archer wants to broker the sale of this magnificent diamond, split the profit with Vandy. Along the way they run into Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly) a crusading reporter who is troubled because her western readers do not seem to care about the plight of war torn Sierra Leone and it's many innocent victims who are caught up in the violence. In one of the many memorable scenes she forcefully expresses her frustration that her heartfelt stories and photos of suffering families will not be enough to make headlines outside of Africa. Americans are unaware(or unconcerned) that Africans are being killed in grave numbers. Instead Americans are transfixed by the inconsequential political events of the day such as the Presidents adulterous activities.<br /><br />To make headlines Maddy Bowen wants some inside information about the diamond smuggling. That is the beauty of this symbiotic relationship between the 3 main characters, they need each other but for vastly different reasons. All three main characters move through a beautiful countryside marred by violence. Out here they often run into violent child soldiers. Vandy, an honestand hard working fisherman knows his son has been caught up in this. He will do anything to get his son back. In another memorable scene (and I won't give away specifics)Vandy finally encounters the person who is abducting children, giving them drugs and forcing them to become child soldiers. The cinematography is outstanding, the ending superb(with a little twist as to the destination and use of the smuggled diamonds). Any Westerner who buys diamonds should feel uneasy after watching this film and thinking about what they may be unintentionally supporting.\", '2008-01-09\\nUS', '52406618', 'R2C0V9SD6S3T4D', '0143034901', '734819982', 'The Shadow of the Wind', 'Books', '5', '0', '0', 'N', 'N', 'An oasis in a sea of murder mysteries', \"I took the recommendation of my book store sales person when I asked for a refreshing novel different from the best seller murder mysteries.

The only other John Green book I ...', \"This book was a simply amazing read.  The only other John Green book I had read prior to this was The Fault in Our Stars.  And I honestly had no interest in reading this book until I saw the trailer for the movie about to come out.  I guess I am sort of a sucker for the 'teens finding themselves' sort of movies.  Perks of Being a Wallflower is the perfect example of such a movie.  I have watched it again and again and again....  The first few chapters had me hooked.  The friendship between Quentin and Margo was touching and special at such a young age.  and then a tragic event pulls them apart at the height of their friendship.  Something that fundamentally changes Margo.  The two remain friends, but not nearly as close as they once were for the next 8 years.  Easily the best part of the book was Margo enlisting Q in her campaign of revenge.  It was funny, satisfying on many levels, and even a bit sad at times.  You could tell (even if you didn't know previously this could be the last time Q and M see each other) that M was going to be leaving.  Some of the dialogue hinted at this.  When the mystery of M's disappearance initially unfolded it was intriguing but got a little stale until later in the book.  Q finds out that M has really changed in those 8 years that they hadn't really seen much of one another.  And not just the vindictive pranks, and running away leaving clues behind, but the way she thought about life.  The way she spent her free time.  and the way she DIDN'T want to spend it with anyone else.  Including her closest friends and family.  There were many signs she was depressed, saddened for some unknown reason.  Perhaps, and likely, triggered, from the reveal of the suicide victim 8 years prior.  But that still remains a mystery.  As is the story of Margo Spiegleman.  When Q finally figures out where M is, a hilarious and at one point, quite serious, road trip ensues.  This is easily the most entertaining part of the book.  But the part where they almost run into several cows throws a curveball into their plans and forces them to think about their plans.  And if Margo really knew how dangerous it would be for them (or perhaps only Q) to come and 'rescue' her.  The payoff delivers probably the best twist of the book.  However, I can't help but feel disappointed as there wasn't more of a reaction from the others in the car, other than Q, about the way Margo was living for the past couple weeks and the fact that she DID NOT leave clues for Q to find.  It was all just a big coincidence that he followed them.  The fact that, after all, he DID know her better than anyone else. Even though their time together had dwindled in the years since the discovery of the body.  I was expecting more of a confrontation between the other friends, seeing as how they did almost die, and were loyal enough to save her from what they thought was her life being in mortal danger.  Likely from herself.  Nonetheless the last 20 or so pages with Q and M talking about M's final plans to leave permanently were fantastically written.  The answers Q had been searching for were revealed and as confused as he was, and maybe even a little frustrated, he was still loyal to her.  and to me that's the real question of the book.  Could you still be loyal to someone as unpredictable and spontaneous as Margo?  Someone who craves attention but loves her alone time just as much?  Too me the book ended on several sort of 'cliffhangers'.  Was margo really going to go through with the rest of her plans to travel and not be a 'paper person' living in one 'paper town' or did Q convince her to stay?  and if she did stay, for how long?  Her reputation proceeds her, it would seem like she would jump at the next opportunity to run off again, on some other grand adventure.  I wasn't surprised by Q's decision to not go with M in the end....  If there's anything the past 2.5 weeks had taught Q, it was that his friends were more loyal to him than Margo had been as of late.  and his parents had supported him more than ever.  that final hug really tugged at my heartstrings though.  Did she run back because she was reluctant to leave?  Or did she just want that one last goodbye?  We'll likely never know for sure..... Here is my interpretation though based on the character's actions:  Margo waited until she was 18 to leave because, legally, she was an adult, who, as it turned out, was NOT in any danger and was supporting herself as best as she could.  she was happy, or least she said she was.  All those other times she ran away she wanted to be found eventually.  It was almost a game.  so I think this is it for her.  She's going to leave and not going to come back.  Despite that final interaction with Q she's going on this trip around the world, even if it kills her.  and she basically said she's willing to accept that fate.  It's kind of a sad ending, but uplifting in a way too.  I absolutely loved and recommend this book.te.  and his parents had supported him more than ever.  that final hug really tugged at my heartstrings though.

It's got simply everything that a Muse album needs; riffs, solos, falsettos, pianos, a freaking 10 minute long Citizen Erased SEQUEL.

A bit more on that last bit, I really do enjoy cooking it's just that I rarely get to make the types of meals that are really fun and exciting mostly because of a lack of time. So my fun with this book took a bit longer than most as I slowly built up a repertoire of recipes from this book. Some of the recipes I made just for the fun and simplicity of it - i.e. Pumpkin juice (substituting canned pumpkin instead of from scratch). Some of the recipes were more intricate - i.e. Steak and Kidney Pie.<br /><br />First though I have to say that if you're a parent or have a favorite child relative this book is a great way to do something fun with them. For me, my partner was my 9 year old nephew on some of the recipes (mostly treats & desserts).<br /><br />All that said, I'm not British and this book can be a bit challenging because although the quality of the instructions is generally very good there are no pictures of the finished dishes. So for someone who's never made steak and kidney pie I had to look up photos of the presentation on my phone/tablet while in the kitchen. This isn't a huge issue for me but is a consideration. On the topic of the books quality I'm quite pleased, missing pictures aside, the pages are nice and thick and good quality paper stock, the trim is that wonderful uneven parchment style that I don't know what is actually called. The hardcover outer binding is great as it's got a smooth durable finish. I've dumped water, egg white and flour on the cover and it still looks new.<br /><br />As far as content, if you're a Potter fan you'll love some of the recipes from Treacle Tart, the aforementioned pumpkin juice, and mince pies. I've never really known the British for their culinary genius but if you're an adventurous eater there are some interesting dishes in here too such as black pudding.<br /><br />Really though this book is squarely aimed at the Potter fan as nearly every recipe here can be easily found online for free.

And this grand film is a testimonial to them.<br /><br />Amazing Grace tells the story of England\\'s attempt to banish slavery from its kingdom. Hurting after the loss of those rapscallion colonies, the British Parliament is debating whether or not to end the African slave trade. One William Wilberforce, a devoted social rights advocate (evidenced by his fondness for animals and the poor), takes up the cause after a particular confrontation with a group of abolitionists one night at dinner. It turns out the journey to end the slave trade begins to wreck his health, and despite some clever ploys to get people to side with him, he ends up strung out on laudanum. Enter Barbara Spooner, herself an advocate for the many social causes that Wilber himself believes in, begins to rejuvinate his devotion and ardor.<br /><br />The performances of Ioan Gruffudd and Romola Garai carry this film throughout. As Wilber, Ioan is passionate and deeply committed to his performance. Early on, we discover that he finds God (or does God find him, he ponders). Rather than being overwrought and preachy, Gruffudd\\'s sense of joy is palpable. Albert Finney\\'s turn as the former slave ship captain that reforms and writes the title song is brief but glorious, making me wish he was in more films.<br /><br />Nothing, the stirring music nor the wonderful performances, can overcome the raw emotion this film has. As the people struggle against great odds, there passion and sense of justice only grows. Somehow, from somewhere, they only get stronger in their search for emancipation. This culminates in a final scene that swells with emotion without ever being melodramatic; with fervor without ever being harried.<br /><br />And as the final scene with the bagpipe and band playing the infamous tune \\\\\\\\\"Amazing Grace\\\\\\\\\" becomes even more than this. It becomes a transformative message of hope, devotion, and ultimately love. What a movie!ormative message of hope, devotion, and ultimately love. What a movie!']\n",

OMG.', \"I had super high expectations and OH MY GOSH THEY WERE MET WITH FLYING COLOURS. We Were Liars by E. Lockhart has swept through the blogosphere in a whirlwind of 5-star reviews that tell you NOTHING ABOUT THE BOOK WHATSOEVER.<br />&#34;Go in blind!&#34; they say.<br />&#34;You can't know anything before you start!&#34; they say.<br /><br />Despite reading multiple reviews and glaring at the vague blurb on Goodreads, I went in with zero idea what the book would be about. Now I have to review it. And you know what?<br />I'm not going to tell you anything except this: read it.<br /><br />Okay! Okay! Calm down! Put down those pitchforks, the post isn't finished yet. I have composed a list, so therefore I can tell you all the reasons WHY you should read this book, without telling you anything about the book. Sound fair? Who am I kidding? I'm never fair. (But I AM wonderful.)<br /><br />WHY YOU SHOULD READ WE WERE LIARS.<br />1. It's set on an island.<br />This is in the blurb, so I'm 100% safe to divulge this incredible fact with you. Oh, and not just any island. If Richie Rich had a private island, this would be it. Shame on you if you don't now Richie Rich, too, by the way. Think: RICH. Money everywhere. This is a family who spends their summers together -- incredibly rich grandfather, daughters, kids.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but islands fascinate me. I would die if I was on a deserted one due to my a) distrust in fish and b) loathing of coconut. So a rich island with private houses, beaches, and doughnuts really appeals to me.<br /><br />2. It's about Cadence, Jonny, Mirren, and Gat.<br />Which is all I can say on this subject, although I will tell you (if you give me chocolate) that it's narrated by Cadence. They're all cousins, except for Gat, who is the partially-adopted-for-the-summer-friend. Every time I saw his name, I subconsciously thought it was a typo. But I DID get over that.

It's tiny.<br />I'm a sucker for small books and We Were Liars is only 220-pages. It means I can eat them in one day if I wish it. And gosh did I WISH IT for this book.

Honestly, blogglings, you ought to be rewarding me.<br /><br />5. It has formatting that makes my delicate pulse flutter.<br />I adore different formatting. Like the kind I raved about in my Notebook Sisters Approved on Half Bad. It makes use of paragraphs, of tension from single sentences. It has teeny tiny chapters. It has segments that are stories that Cadence is telling.<br /><br />6. John Green recommended it.<br />What can I say? He's &#34;just read it&#34; endorsement is plastered on More Than This and I adored that book to pieces too. Basically: trust John Green. Despite all weirdness, TRUST JOHN GREEN.<br /><br />7.

      "['Review of  The End of Faith <br /> <br /> What a book this is!  I have bought 21 copies to distribute to friends and family members and told many others it is a \\\\\\\\must read\\\\\\\\\".  It takes only a quick assessment of the world around us and the last 3000 years of history to disclose the troubling impact religion in all its dogmatic and adversarial diversity has had on the quest for tolerance and peace.  But, as Harris says, \\\\\\\\\"... technology has a way of creating fresh moral imperatives.\\\\\\\\\"  We live in a world soon adrift in easily procured suitcase sized WMDs which cannot long survive the passions unleashed by faith, driven on by \\\\\\\\\"...the fantastical notions that have lurked in the minds of the faithful for millennia.\\\\\\\\\"  Then he adds, \\\\\\\\\"There is no doubt these developments mark the terminal phase of our credulity.\\\\\\\\\"  This all seems so incredibly obvious, yet I am reminded of Thomas Huxley\\'s famous comment on reading Charles Darwin\\'s explanation that evolution results from natural selection operating on variations within populations, \\\\\\\\\"How incredibly stupid of me not to have thought of this myself!\\\\\\\\\" <br /> <br /> The End of Faith is no doubt flawed in places as some critics have pointed out, but what book isn\\'t?  Perhaps he does go on in the later chapters at too much length to hold all but the most persistent of readers.  I hung on and it was worth it. <br /> <br /> Harris is particularly perceptive when he recognizes religious moderates as protectors and enablers of fundamentalist fervor.  \\\\\\\\\"And they do not want anything too critical said about people who really believe in the God of their fathers, because tolerance, perhaps above all else, is sacred. To speak plainly and truthfully about the state of the world, to say, for instance, that the Bible and the Koran both contain mountains of life-destroying gibberish - is antithetical to tolerance as moderates currently conceive it.\\\\\\\\\"   <br />Gibberish for Harris is at the basis of faith.  It reminds me of a quip I once saw on the Web... <br /> \\\\\\\\\"And God said unto them, \\\\\\\\\"And who do you say that I am?\\' <br />And they replied, \\\\\\\\\"You are the eschatological manifestation of the ground of our being, the ontological foundation of the context of our very selfhood revealed.\\' <br /> And God said unto them, `What??\\'\\\\\\\\\" <br /> <br /> Summing up the effect of religious moderates, Harris declares, they \\\\\\\\\"... are in large part, responsible for all the religious conflict in our world, because their beliefs provide the context in which scriptural literalism and religious violence can never be adequately opposed.\\\\\\\\\"  Remember when the Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwah (death sentence) against Salmon Rushdie because he had written The Satanic Verses, in which he dared to criticize a badly flawed religion.  For this outrageous and unjustifiable abrogation of a person\\'s right to free speech, not one, not one responsible Muslim in all of Islam spoke out to condemn this intolerance.  Somehow we allow ourselves to be cowed by the self-righteous. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Also, I liked Harris\\' recognition of and allowance for a spiritual dimension to our psyche - but one that \\\\\\\\\"...must be deeply rational.  I find that I am often awed by natural phenomena, explained or unexplained, but I am not over-awed!\\\\\\\\\"  All in all The End of Faith is remarkably elegant, relentlessly logical and in many places just a thrill to read.  Seldom have I read any book as quotable. <br /> <br /> I too heard Sam Harris at the recent conference in Buffalo, \\\\\\\\\"Toward a New Enlightenment\\\\\\\\\".  Believe me, Sam is for real and a force to be reckoned with in the faith-reason debate.  What is troubling about the book is that there is probably no way reason can prevail over faith soon enough!  Religious zeal may have already set the stage for the demise of civilization as we know it.  Fanaticism and WMDs simply do not mix.   <br /> <br />But surely, to recognize squarely this crossroads in history is to offer some hope.  Harris, explicitly or not, puts the onus on each of us.  Ex-seminarian Daniel Quinn in his visionary novel The Story of B (1996) chronicles the all-too-familiar and parallel ecological catastrophe we also face.  Because of sacrosanct religious beliefs and a growth-at-any-cost syndrome, we face a clearly unsustainable future.  At the end of the book the protagonist, ex-priest Jared Osborne - now a disciple of his mentor, the teacher B, who as been assassinated by the Church as the Anti-Christ - repeat\\'s B\\'s words,  <br />\\\\\\\\\"The Anti-Christ isn\\'t just the antithesis of Jesus, he\\'s equally the antithesis of Buddha, of Elijah, of Moses, of Mohammed, of Nanak, of Joseph Smith, of Maharaj Ji - of all saviors and purveyors of salvation in the world.  He is in fact the Anti-Savior.  B means to steal the hearts of the people away from you [i.e., the great religious faiths] so that the world may live...The world must live, the world must live!  We are only one species among billions.  The gods don\\'t love us more than they love spiders or bears or whales or water lilies...Now we remember who we are.  Our kin are not cherubim, seraphim, thrones, principalities, and powers.  Our kin are mayflies, lemurs, snakes, eagles, and badgers...We can no longer believe that suffering is the lot the gods had in mind for us.  We can no longer believe that death is sweet release to our true destiny.  We no longer yearn for the nothingness of Nirvana.  We no longer dream of wearing crowns of gold in the royal court of heaven...You\\'re right to see that we\\'re straying from the path of salvation.  We\\'re straying from the path exactly as you always feared we might.  But listen, we\\'re not straying from the path of salvation for the sake of sin and corruption, as you always imagined we might.  We\\'re straying from the path of salvation - but not for love of vice and wickedness as you contemptuously imagined we might.  We\\'re straying from the path of salvation for love of the world, as you never once dreamed in a thousand years of dreaming.\\\\\\\\\"<br /> <br />B is, therefore, the great hope.  But who, exactly, is B?  Who will carry on the torch of freethought and emancipation?  At the very end the reader learns the truth and is told, you have now read and understand the words and it is too late.  \\\\\\\\\"The contagion has been spread.  You are B.\\\\\\\\\"  It is you who must carry on! <br /> <br />Likewise, the answers to the dilemma Harris so clearly delineates must be found in ourselves.  Buy The End of Faith, get your friends to read it and debate it.  It is one of those books like The Story of B which can change one\\'s life! <br /> <br />Thank you, Sam Harris! <br /> <br /> <br />        Stefan Shoup <br /> Big Falls, WI <br /> Dec. 13, 2005 <br />']\n",

Rachel drinks heavily, with resultant blackouts, and has lost her job. She is obsessed with Tom and Anna, and harasses them mercilessly.<br />Anna is the new wife, and rather proud of herself at having gotten her man. She is somewhat arrogant, and, although she had a successful career, she now is a stay at home mom, and she is unhappy in that role.<br />Megan is a beautiful woman who lives down the street, and she is married to Scott. Megan has a difficult past, and her depression leads her to see a psychologist. Megan needs more excitement in her life than staying home alone all day waiting for her husband to come home from work.<br />The lives of this group of people becomes intertwined when Megan disappears.<br />Rachel, even though she no longer has a job, rides a train to London every morning and home every evening. On her train ride she passes the back of her old home (now shared by Tom and Anna), and also the home of Scott and Megan. Megan is often out on her patio, either alone or with Scott, which Rachel observes from the train, and Rachel proceeds to build a perfect fantasy life for Megan and Scott, neither of whom she has ever met. One day she sees an unknown man kissing Megan on the patio, just before Megan goes missing. Rachel involves herself into the investigation and into the life of Megan's husband Scott. She was wandering around the neighborhood the night Megan went missing, but, due to her blackouts, doesn't know if she has observed anything or not.<br />The story goes on from here, eventually to its conclusion.<br />None of the characters are very likeable, and I found the drinking bouts quite depressing. Rachel's behavior seems unlikely to me, and it looks as though she causes most of her own problems. There are times you want to shake her and tell her not to be an idiot.<br />Having said all that, reading the book becomes quite compulsive as the story goes on, and you find yourself unable to put it down.<br />I recommend this book, it is different from other books, and it makes you stop and think.<br />I do think that Rachel's drinking and her behavior becomes quite tiresome, and that maybe the book is a little longer than it needs to be, but all in all, a very interesting read.\", '2014-11-04\\nUS', '28996817', 'R3KR1UKYZ32DOR', 'B00HAVVOFC', '926355792', 'The Infidel Soldiers (Hard Knock Life Book 3)', 'Digital_Ebook_Purchase', '5', '1', '2', 'N', 'Y', 'Recommended', 'Very interesting book I definitely recommend reading this.', '2014-11-04\\nUS', '43973919', 'R2O5MG34JZ9MX1', 'B00992CF6W', '9632738', 'Minecraft', 'Mobile_Apps', '5', '0', '0', 'N', 'Y', 'AMAZING GAME', \"This version of minecraft has many features it has everything from fallen trees to stone. the worlds are infinite but it's very blocky.

This is one of those times.<br /><br />What made Tull different was complexity. Lyrics that explored deep topics and avoided cliches. Arrangements that took unexpected directions and used unusual instrumentation (portive organs on tour). Selection of musicians that drove a masculine energy with their own special style (Barre's staccato guitar riffs, Doane's emphasis on toms and unique fills).<br /><br />This CD has almost none of it. Being a songwriter myself, the one thing that always gets my attention ... in the wrong way ... are cliches, which are typically absent in Anderson's prose. On this CD I cannot think of a song that didn't have at least one. After days with the CD in the dash, I'm hard pressed to recall a lyric at all.<br /><br />As for the band ... all competent musicians, but if Anderson's &#34;Rubbing Elbows&#34; tours are an indication, he picked these lads up at union scale. Opahle's guitar is mainly power chords and none of the energy filled lifts like Barre can do. Hammond keeps tempo on drums, but the fills are predictable and the accents are not there. O'Hara did some nice keyboard work that was reminiscent of John Evans, but that was a single saving grace. I can't recall hearing anything that bassist Goodier did that was memorable (bring back Pegg!)<br /><br />I wish I had heard something with which to recommend this CD ... but I didn't.

This review will mainly focus on the hardware itself, although it is tightly integrated with the Adobe software.<br /><br />The Ink, a pressure-sensitive stylus pen comes with a carrying protective case whose lid doubles as the charger. The Ink is magnetically coupled to the lid, which is then connected to a power source via the supplied micro-USB cable. The lid has a LED colored ring to indicate the charging status. The Slide, a digital ruler, doesn't need charging and operates on the capacitive touch screen of an iPad.<br /><br />The Ink has a beautifully crafted aluminum body with a twisted triangular shape and a plastic tip. I actually find the pen quite natural and comfortable to hold in my hand. The Slide has a matching aluminum top body and a plastic base. The Ink and Slide is tightly integrated with the Adobe Creative Cloud. While the ink can be used as a regular stylus pen with any drawing app, its full potential is only realized with the Adobe Line and Sketch apps, partly through a button each on the Ink and the Slide. The apps are free to download in the App Store.<br /><br />Setup is very easy. Pairing of the Ink is done through the Adobe apps, instead of through the iOS directly. During pairing, you can assign a user specific color to the full color-spectrum LED at the top of the Ink, which helps you to identify your own pen in a collaborative environment. The Slide doesn't need pairing and will be recognized in the apps once it's placed on the touch screen.<br /><br />The Ink has a problem with its precision. I couldn't get the Ink to consistently trace the same after drawing an initial line. Sometimes it's spot on but other times it's a line width away. It can be a frustrating experience if you're trying to draw a sketch that requires high precision. Now onto the Slide. The Slide works pretty well on my iPad Air but I imagine itcan be more cramped and tricky to use on a smaller touch screen like the iPad Mini since it can block a large portion of the screen.<br /><br />My final thought. The Ink and Slide is elegant and certainly has its strength with the Adobe Creative Cloud for mobile artists. It's not perfect and has a precision problem that can be a deal breaker for some users. Furthermore, it is too expensive for what it is. If you have no use for the Slide, you can get the Adonit Jot Touch with Pixelpoint stylus for under $100 which shares the same pressure sensitive stylus technology with the Ink. There is serious competition out there and Adobe hasn't convinced me enough to shell out the full $200 price yet.\", '2014-11-04\\nUS', '11394122', 'RULHSQMWH7229', 'B009ZQC7MY', '459613388', 'Downton Abbey Season 3', 'Digital_Video_Download', '4', '0', '0', 'N', 'N', 'Downton Love', 'Love love the Downton clan', '2014-11-04\\nUS', '49368614', 'R1J5NVM0CKRVTE', 'B00B7NPRY8', '88529599', 'Dune', 'Digital_Ebook_Purchase', '5', '0', '0', 'N', 'N', 'Superb.

You can also select to turn on permanent death.  The game has excellent graphics and sound effects.  The music is perfect for the time the game is set in.  The controls are easy to use and the levels move quickly.<br /><br />As you move through the rooms you kill evil creatures and soldiers with your sword.  You collect gold and you can enhance your heath by collecting hearts.  At the end of each level you meet the boss of that level and you have to defeat him to move on.  On the casual mode it is fun and easy.<br /><br />After the level you can cash in your gold and upgrade your weapons and purchase shields, armor and crowns.  Enhanced weapons can do more attack damage, shields help you to block enemy attacks, armor grants you more lives and crowns enhance the amount of treasure you can find.  The cost of the upgrades goes up dramatically every time you move up a level and you get more gold.  The cost of enhancing your weapons tripled in three levels.<br /><br />I like that in the game if you die you do back to a recent check point and you do not have to start over.

If you haven\\'t read the first part already, go to the page for [[ASIN:B00M2OZLQK Venus and Mars]].    Wings at the Speed of Sound was quite a big seller when it was released in 1976. The reviews for the album, however, did not match with the sales: reviews were mixed, most feeling that the album was weak. For me, At the Speed of Sound is a strange album. There are some great songs on here but compared to Venus and Mars, it feels like the band went soft on this one. Still, At the Speed of Sound is not a bad album at all.     Speed of Sound features two of the band\\'s biggest hits- \\\\\\\\Let `Em In\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\"Silly Love Songs.\\\\\\\\\" While there are some people who don\\'t like these songs (especially the latter), I have a soft spot for them. There are other great songs on here with some of them sounding better when performed live. For example, Laine\\'s \\\\\\\\\"Time to Hide\\\\\\\\\" and the heavy \\\\\\\\\"Beware My Love\\\\\\\\\" are great songs but have more of a punch to them when they were performed live. Speed of Sound also holds the distinction of being the only Wings album to feature all of the members singing at least one song. Laine gets two sing two songs- the aforementioned \\\\\\\\\"Time to Hide\\\\\\\\\"  and his sorrowful \\\\\\\\\"The Note You Never Wrote\\\\\\\\\" (the latter of which has a killer guitar solo).  Being a fan of McCulloch, I do enjoy the guitar-driven \\\\\\\\\"Wino Junko,\\\\\\\\\" which is another rocker about the dangers of drugs (unfortunately for McCulloch, he would die from a drug overdose three years after the release of this album). Joe English even gets to sing a song- the McCartney-penned \\\\\\\\\"Must Do Something About It,\\\\\\\\\" which is a really great deep track on here. English\\'s voice is sensational on here and I wish he had leant his vocals on more Wings tracks (After English left Wings, he had a career as a Christian Rock artist). While Linda McCartney is sorely missed by all of us, I have to admit that \\\\\\\\\"Cook of the House\\\\\\\\\" was not one of her best moments.    As for the remastering, it\\'s quite strong. My previous copy of Speed of Sound was a CD issue released 1989. Compared to that, this new remaster is way better. I\\'ve said before that Speed of Sound has been a strange album for me, but I think the new remaster makes me appreciate it a little more. For me, the bass is ridiculously good. It stands out remarkable. Just listen to \\\\\\\\\"Silly Love Songs\\\\\\\\\" and you\\'ll see (or rather hear) what I\\'m talking about.     The bonus disc for Speed of Sound is quite disappointing, as it consists of only 21 minutes of material. Still, none of the seven tracks on here have been released. There is an interesting take of \\\\\\\\\"Beware My Love\\\\\\\\\" featuring John Bonham of Led Zeppelin pounding away at the drums. The demos for \\\\\\\\\"Silly Love Songs\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\"Let `Em In\\\\\\\\\" are interesting, as you get to hear Paul harmonize with Linda and Denny respectively.     Overall, I\\'ve enjoyed both reissues of Venus and Mars and Speed of Sound. Both albums sound great and for me, are better than any other versions of the album I\\'ve owned before. For those of you who own the 1993 remasters, it\\'s completely up to you. If you were happy with the previous reissues in this series, I\\'d say go for it and buy them.    It should also noted that with these two reissues, all of the albums on the small paper ad that came with the [[ASIN:B003XX2O8C Band on the Run (Archive Collection)]] reissue have been released: [[ASIN:B004WJRF6C McCartney (Archive Collection)]] , [[ASIN:B004WJREMW McCartney II (Archive Collection)]], [[ASIN:B007L96VCY RAM]], [[ASIN:B00C7NKPPS Wings Over America [Standard Edition]]] and now [[ASIN:B00M2OZLQK Venus and Mars]] and Speed of Sound. The Paul McCartney Archive Collection will now continue with the reissues of Tug of War and Pipes of Peace.']\n",
