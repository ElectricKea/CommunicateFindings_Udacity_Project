      "['Showtime is the Reality-TV era\\'s answer to Cop/Buddy movies like the Lethal Weapon series. When a dedicated detective (Robert De Niro) shoots a TV camera during a bust, the Network offers the LAPD a choice: A lawsuit, or the use of De Niro for a reality based show. The camera-shy de Niro is not thrilled, to say the least. And when he finds out that he will be partnered up with Trey \\\\\\\\Ice Trey\\\\\\\\\" Sellers, a frustrated (Bad!) Actor/Beat Cop, the fur starts to fly.<br />   Murphy and De Niro are on the trail of a vicious Club Owner who is in posession of a batch of specially made guns; They fire such large rounds that they are capable of knocking down houses. You can imagine what they\\'ll do to a bullet-proof vest...<br />  Showtime has some really great action sequences; The climax was actually something that I had never seen before in a movie. Points for originality! The real selling point is the pairing of Eddie Murphy and Robert de Niro. The two are priceless when they are onscreen together, and there are more laugh-out-loud moments in this film than I could count. (Sequel, PLEASE!!!!) William Shatner plays himself in a small cameo: He\\'s there to teach the guys how to act like TV Cops- Hood Jumping, Door Rolling, etc. Just the spectacle of seeing Shatner, Murphy & De Niro in the same scene is funny....<br />  And make sure to stick around for the outtake reel after the film ends. Great stuff! There should be one HELL of a DVD for this film....']\n",

Note that I don\\'t really do stars.  To me a book is either worth reading or it isn\\'t.  I can\\'t rate it three-fifths worth reading, so all you\\'ll ever see from me is a five-star or a one-star (since no stars isn\\'t a rating, unfortunately).    A Universe From Nothing: Why There Is Something Rather Than Nothing has been a very controversial book and for no good reason. If you search for reviews on it, what pops up in abundance is Christian websites desperately trying not to refute it (they can’t) but to discredit it! That\\'s a good sign, because it means that it seriously shredded yet another facet of their inane fairy tale, and like a wounded wild animal, they’re lashing out blindly in their pain. This is a routine knee-jerk reaction which we see every time a new Richard Dawkins book comes out, for example.    I\\'m a big fan of Lawrence Krauss, but I think he did a better job in the popular books which first brought him to wide-spread recognition than he does here. His The Physics of Star Trek And Beyond Star Trek are amazing and very accessible, and I highly recommend them. The second was, I think, better than the first. Here in this book, he\\'s not looking at how realistic (or otherwise) science fiction is, he\\'s actually looking at the meaning of science which is so advanced that it might appear like science fiction (or even fantasy) to people who either don’t take the trouble to understand it, or who are arbitrarily predisposed (from the thorough religious indoctrination most people are subject to from childhood) to dismiss it out of hand.    But while I think he could have done a lot better job in conveying his ideas (and perhaps an even better job in reading them - I listened to the audio book version, which Krauss reads himself, and not always very clearly), I still think he made his case. The question is what case was it he was making? People assume he was simply making a claim that everything came from nothing and he proved it in this book, but that\\'s not actually what he\\'s saying.    In his own words, in an interview, Krauss put it this way: \\\\\\\\\"...I\\'ll be the first to say that empty space as I\\'m describing it isn\\'t necessarily nothing, although I will add that it was plenty good enough for Augustine and the people who wrote the Bible. For them an eternal empty void was the definition of nothing, and certainly I show that that kind of nothing ain\\'t nothing anymore.\\\\\\\\\" That\\'s an excellent interview and I recommend reading it. It clarifies a lot of things and makes obsolete a lot of the arguments people have tried to raise in the wake of this book. The link was good at the time this review was first posted.    My only complaint is about the clarity, as I\\'ve mentioned. I think Krauss could have done a better job of explaining in some portions of the book, and he certainly could have done a better job of reading those parts! Perhaps the audio book isn’t the best way to absorb this book, not least because it skips all of the illustrations and diagrams. That said I recommend the book because I think it does exactly what the title promises for theistic definitions of nothing.    If you can\\'t get the book, but you do have Internet access, then you can watch a recording of Krauss giving a lecture which is the essence or even the prototype of this book. It\\'s in this video that we can enjoy gems like: \\\\\\\\\"Forget Jesus, the stars died so that you could be here today!\\\\\\\\\" and \\\\\\\\\"Empty space is responsible for 90% of your mass.\\\\\\\\\" I recommend this book.']\n",

      "[\"...Maybe better than all the rest / 'Maybe' is a wrapper for a value that's possibly null...&#34;<br /><br />For a long time now, Haskell has been a computer science talisman: what the *real* nerds dug. A purely functional programming language that could still do everything you needed to write usable code is some trick, but explaining how the trick is turned has always eluded would-be expositors of the language. Miran Lipovaca, a Slovene CS student, managed to succeed where others have floundered: using well-chosen examples, cute graphics and an up-to-date sense of humor, Lipovaca systematically lays out the core language constructs of Haskell and shows the non-functional programmer most of how it's done. Although others have complained that the book lags at the end, where more complicated ideas are introduced, I think Lipovaca's explanation of monads and other tricky bits is pretty good; he is clear throughout that Haskell is not really about lambdas (which most major programming languages now have) but about systematic transformations of data based on concepts deriving from category theory, and before that the combinatory logic of Haskell Curry himself.<br /><br />Just like reading Kernighan and Ritchie didn't make you a C wizard, *Learn You a Haskell* is an introductory text you will have to move on from, but as a beginning it's just as full-featured as the &#34;mainstream&#34; Haskell books from major tech presses. It is a little weird to see functors described as &#34;things you can map over&#34;, rather than the mappings themselves that they are in category theory, but Lipovaca is teaching practice not theory and the scary definitions of things like monoids are rather miraculously translated into sprightly English. Ponderous and tendentious tomes on The Very Ideas of computer science are often described as expanding your CS consciousness, but if you haven't delved into the functional side of programming (which, in the form of the impure Clojure and Scala, is coming to real projects near you) this is a hip mind-expander.

Yes, they made their name off the success of The Final Countdownera; and while that was the sound of the band at that time, it actually is not a true reflection of the band, for there is far more to these Swedish superstars than that one period of their career. For the better part of the 1990s the band went their separate ways but released new material in 2004 with a harder, more edgy brand of rock and roll. Since then the band have stayed true to this course releasing several more high quality records, and in 2015 the band returns with War Of Kings.<br /><br />The standard version of the album features 11 tracks, while a deluxe edition contains a bonus track. For me, this record harkens back to the early days of the band during the Europe/Wings Of Tomorrow era of 1983/84, and yet at the same time they manage to maintain a modern twist that reflects the past decade for the band. Any number of songs here could have featured on various past albums.<br /><br />Take for example the title track which kicks off the album; here is the perfect blend of paying tribute to the past while embracing the here and now. The verses are very modern but it is the chorus where this song really comes into its own with a strong 1984 flavour. Hole In My Pocket is the next track to explode out of the speakers with guitarist John Norum putting in a cracking performance and drummer Ian Haugland killing it behind the drums, the song is pacey and full of groove. Second Day is an edgy mid-tempo rocker with another big traditional Europe style chorus.<br /><br />The band has made no secret about being influenced by the likes of Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and Black Sabbath, and on numerous tracks that influence shines through. Praise You, Nothin’ To Ya and Days Of Rock N’ Roll all have shades of hero influence running through them. Children Of The Mind is a funky, psychedelic, grungy style cut while Rainbow Bridge draws on Middle Eastern flavours. The only ballad on the record is Angels (With Broken Wings) and while this song did not set my world on fire, my hat does go off to singer Joey Tempest who puts in a stunning vocal performance. The album concludes with the groove fest rocker Light Me Up on the standard CD and the bluesy instrumental Vasastan on the deluxe edition.<br /><br />If all you know about this band is that late 1980s Final Countdown/Out Of This World period of the band’s history, then I strongly suggest to give this album a miss. There is no reliving those glory days to be found here. This is for those that were there from the beginning, who remember Europe before they went commercial or those who picked up the band post 1990s.yle cut while Rainbow Bridge draws on Middle Eastern flavours.

As each new collaboration comes out, the standard of music being produced continues to soar higher and higher. The latest group of high profile musicians to come together is Revolution Saints, and they are redefining the boundaries of musical genius. Ever since it was announced last year that Doug Aldrich (Ex-Whitesnake/Burning Rain) was teaming up with Jack Blades (Night Ranger/Damn Yankees) and Deen Castronovo (Ex-Bad English/Journey) for this new project and that they would release a debut album in early 2015, it has been on my very long ‘Most Anticipated Albums’ list. And take it from me, the results do not disappoint.<br /><br />Revolution Saints in short, sounds like the love child of Damn Yankees and Journey; it is just that simple. A criticism that could be levelled at the project is that every song on the record sounds too much like the track before. But for me, this is the album’s strength. What the band has done well is identify what their sound is and selected the best songs at their disposal which represents the Revolution Saints brand. It is simple quality control, resulting in a classy self titled album.<br /><br />From moment one this 12 track/54 minute masterpiece is dripping with catchy melodies, multi-layered harmonies and scorching guitar work from Aldrich. At one point I started wondering if the fire brigade were sent out to extinguish him he is that smoking. Let me be clear, Aldrich is a damn genius as he shreds his way through track after track, and if anyone doubted his validity as a guitar God the proof is evident on this record. The real surprise for me came from Castronovo; not for his drumming, I have known for a long time that he is a monster behind the kit. The surprise here is his incredible vocal work. From time to time he has sung lead on the odd Journey track in recent years but I was never sure he could carry an entire album; I am glad to say he put those concerns to bed.<br /><br />The first two singles Back On My Trail and Back In Time kick off the record and set the tone for what is to come. Castronovo’s Journey band mates, Arnel Pineda and Neil Schon make their presence felt on You’re Not Alone andWay To The Sun, respectively. While cuts like Locked Out Of Paradise, Dream On, Strangers To This Life, Better World and How To Mend A Broken Heart elevate the album to a higher level. And as you would expect from an album of this nature, the band fills their quota of big ballads adequately on songs like Don’t Walk Away and the album closer In The Name Of The Father.<br /><br />It is possible that Castronovo, Blades and Aldrich have been saving their best to create this record. At least, that is how I felt listening to it. It’s the old clich&eacute;, “… has never sounded so good” but in this instance it is actually true. The performances by all involved are through the stratosphere and have laid down a very high benchmark for the band to reach should they return to record another album.

But this new studio effort is by far the band’s most diverse collaboration of material and pushes the band to expand its branding.<br /><br />In many cases a band’s third album is the make or break moment of their career; it can solidify your position in the industry or give you the opportunity to break new ground. On Into The Wild Life the band chose to break from past practices and adopt new methods of writing and recording. They moved to Nashville to record the album and employed the services of producer Jay Joyce (The Wallflowers/Eric Church), who challenged them with his own techniques of album making and forced them to push themselves beyond what they had known. The results speak for themselves.<br /><br />Cuts like I Am The Fire, Amen, Mayhem, Gonna Get Mine, Apocalyptic and I Like It Heavy stay true to the Halestorm brand of hard rock which the band has built its foundations on. But there are several tracks which redefine what the band parameters are, and hence bring something different to the table on this recording. For example, What Sober Couldn’t Say is a laid back mid-tempo number which features Hammond organ. Not what I would expect to find on a Halestorm record, it is only subtle, but it works really well. And then there is New Modern Love which oozes Nashville influence, and Bad Girls World which may not be out of place on a P!nk album. Dear Daughter is a nice piano driven ballad, however towards the back end of the song it launches into this strange David Bowie-esque type territory.<br /><br />The album also sees the continuing rise of singer/guitarist Lzzy Hale. Her performance on this record is simply top notch as she shifts gears from hard rock powerhouse to tender storyteller. The rest of the band can lay claim to elevating their individual performances as well. Drummer Arejay Hale is a good example; on Into The Wild Life he experiments with different patterns, rhythms and time signatures to create a fresh sounding backdrop to many of the tracks, but also leaves room for the standard straight ahead approach. A mention must also go to guitarist Joe Hottinger who really delivers scorching riffs and solos when requires, but also knows when to hold back and let others in the band have their moment. He also brings with him some different styles and techniques of guitar playing on various tracks which add to the overall sonic diversity.<br /><br />Before this album was released I honestly thought what they would serve up would be more of what had come before and I was really not expecting some of what I heard here. But what I got was a sign of maturity and growth and I think this album brings the band to a crossroads; where they choose to go from here will be interesting. Into The Wild Life is a great record; if you are expecting Halestorm 2.0 it may take you a couple of listens to come around, however once it gets its hooks into you it will not let go.op notch as she shifts gears from hard rock powerhouse to tender storyteller.

That Death is the narrator was a plot twist that was present from the outset, & this just made the book more intriguing.  I also appreciated that while set during WW2, the reader sees the war from the perspective of a German girl living with foster parents, which is a viewpoint to which I'm unaccustomed.  Zusak gives enough foreshadowing that the reader wants to read quickly to reach that point in the story to find out how that particular event occurred.
