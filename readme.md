# Exploration of Amazon consumer products reviews
## by Kyle McMillan


## Dataset

The dataset is approximatly 7 million reviews from Amazon's US marketplace. The reviews are from 1996 to 2006 and included 38
categories. The reviews contain the star rating, and helpfulness of the review to other by the way of votes against the review. 
The dataset also includes the full title and body of the review that was made, as well as other aspects of the review.
Details and feature documentation about the dataset can be found in Amazon review dataset index.txt.


## Summary of Findings

An interesting point that I discovered early on was that the majority, more than 4 million, of the stars given to a review 
were a perfect 5 star rating. I also found that a lot of customers only made 1 review
In the exploration I found the strongest relationship was between the total number of votes and the number of helpful votes, 
but that can be expected as the more total votes there are, the greater the number of helpful votes there will be. As such 
these 2 features had a linear relationship.
